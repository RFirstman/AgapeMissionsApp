# Agape Missions App

This is a work in progress App for the Agape Missions non-profit. The application is built using React-Native

## How to Run

First, make sure to install the Expo app to your mobile device.

Next, [install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). It is required to run the application.

Third, [install Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html). This is also needed to run the application.
Note: on Mac, this requires you to have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

Once you have that installed, clone this repository to somewhere on your computer. Next, 
install the project dependencies using NPM (which was added by Node.js).

```
git clone
cd AgapeMissionsApp/
npm install
```

Finally, run the application!

```
npm start
```

Once the packager starts, press `s`, type in your phone number, and hit enter. This will 
send a link to your phone. Click on the link to open Expo and view the application! You 
can also do this by copying this link and entering it into Expo.
